# 🐾 Wildlife Species Identifier & Conservation Platform

A web-based platform that empowers users to identify wildlife species using cutting-edge Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and fosters a collaborative community for biodiversity conservation.

## 🌿 Project Overview

This platform serves as both a **species identification tool** and a **hub for conservation enthusiasts**. Users can upload wildlife images, receive species identification using machine learning models, and contribute to a growing database of biodiversity. By integrating **Java-based backend logic** with a simple, intuitive **HTML/CSS frontend**, the system bridges technology and environmental activism.

## 💡 Key Features

* 🔍 **Image-Based Species Identification**
  Upload wildlife images to get species predictions powered by CNNs.

* 🌍 **Community Conservation Hub**
  Share findings, support conservation events, and collaborate with other nature enthusiasts.

* 🧠 **Machine Learning Integration**
  Use of Convolutional Neural Networks to ensure high accuracy in species detection.

* 📈 **Data Collection for Biodiversity Research**
  Contributions support a growing dataset useful for ecological studies and wildlife protection efforts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3
* **Backend**: Java (Servlets, File Handling, etc.)
* **Machine Learning**: CNN (Python-based model, integrated with backend via APIs or data transfer)

## 🌱 Impact

* Promotes **biodiversity awareness** through interactive learning.
* Encourages **public participation** in environmental conservation.
* Builds a **citizen science ecosystem** to support ecological research.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Deploy the backend Java files (like `Addimage.java` and `Display.java`) on a local or server-based servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat).
3. Access the platform through your web browser and start uploading images for identification.
4. Join the community and share your observations!

## 📸 Sample Workflow

1. **Upload** a wildlife image through the form.
2. **Receive prediction** (e.g., "Indian Leopard" or "Spotted Deer").
3. **Contribute** to the community conservation board or tag sightings by location.

## 🤝 Contribute

We welcome contributions from wildlife lovers, researchers, and developers! Whether it’s improving the ML model, enhancing UI/UX, or adding new features—your help is valued.
